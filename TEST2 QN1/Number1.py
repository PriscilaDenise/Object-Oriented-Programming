Part (a): Character and Vehicle Classes

Character class
Create two classes: Character and Vehicle.
For the Character class, include at least three attributes (e.g., name, health, position) and
three methods (e.g., move(), attack(), interact()).

Part (d): Handling Different Types of Objects with Polymorphism
Use polymorphism to create methods that allow the game to handle different types of objects 
(e.g., different character types or vehicles).
